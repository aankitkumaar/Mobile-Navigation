# Mobile-Navigation


Instruction :-

Divide the whole UI Into Divs.
See how they have centred the whole layout and used border radius and shadow
for styling!
You can use flexbox for the layout and positioning.
And you can select the icons from here: https://fontawesome.com/icons

Mobile tab navigation 2

A detail that you might have missed: The colour of the bottom border is not the
same as the colour of bottom navigation bar!
Try your best to create this UI and implement it in the cool stuff you make in future.
Experiment with the colours, add your favourite wallpaper and make this yours!
If you can, try to make the colour of the icons change on hovering using CSS!
